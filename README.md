# ABOUT
Inspired by 3blue1brown, I used animations to understand the Statistical Learning Theory Framework and made a video on it. This repo contains the code used to do the animations.

**Topics covered:**

i.i.d assumption\
Law of large numbers and Hoeffding's inequality\
PAC Learning\
Feasibility of Learning for finite and infinite hypothesis\
Bias - Complexity trade off\
VC Dimension ( not included in video )\
VC Proof ( not included in video )

I wrote this code with video editing in mind. Hence it might be difficult to understand.
